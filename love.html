          <h1 class="sub">John the Baptist </h1>
          <p> 
            John the Baptist was a key prophetic figure in the New Testament, known for his role in preparing the way for Jesus Christ. He preached a message of repentance and baptized people in the Jordan River, symbolizing the washing away of sins. John is also recognized for baptizing Jesus, marking the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. He is often portrayed as a voice calling out in the wilderness, urging people to turn back to God. John’s life ended in martyrdom when he was beheaded by order of King Herod, after John condemned Herod's unlawful marriage to Herodias.

            John the Apostle 
            <br> <br>
            John the Apostle, also known as John the Evangelist, was one of Jesus' original twelve disciples. He is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of John, three Epistles (1 John, 2 John, and 3 John), and the Book of Revelation. He is often referred to as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" and is portrayed as having a close relationship with Jesus. John was a fisherman by trade before being called to follow Jesus, and he, along with his brother James, were part of Jesus' inner circle of disciples. According to tradition, John was the only apostle who did not die a martyr’s death and lived to an old age, continuing to share the teachings of Christ.
            
            Both figures played crucial roles in the early Christian narrative, each serving different purposes but contributing significantly to the spread of Christianity.</p>
